# Basic Checks

There are three main tools in this basic tests.

- `scripts/basic_check.py` - this python script checks the following components
  - `--sw` - this prints the necessary software versions (kernel, OFED, ibverbs, perftest)
  - `--perf` - this checks the basic performance (throughput and latency) for this RDMA host using `perftest` (`ib_write_bw` and `ib_write_lat`)  
  - `--fw` - this checks the firmware version (currently for Nvidia Mellanox only)
  - `--qos` - this checks the QoS configuration (currently for Nvidia Mellanox only)

- `scripts/config_check.py` - this python script checks the performance-related configurations
  - by default, this script checks MTU, PCIe configuration, and NIC fw/hw configurations (currently for Nvidia Mellanox only)

- `src/control_check` - this binary evaluates the basic control verbs performance (for allocation only).
